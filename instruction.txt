I'm converting currency bot.
Commands:
/start, /help - instruction
/values - available currencies
For use send me a message:
<currency for which you need> <currency at which you need> <amount of currency>
A short letter code is used to indicate the currency (see the list by command /values)
For example:
RUB USD 1000
Enjoy using
